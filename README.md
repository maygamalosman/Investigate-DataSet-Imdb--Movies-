# TMDB Movies Dataset Overview

## Project Summary
The TMDB Movies dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This dataset includes various attributes such as user ratings, revenue, budgets, and more, allowing for in-depth analysis of the film industry.

## Objectives
The project aims to:
- Understand the dataset and clean unnecessary or missing values.
- Analyze the cleaned data to derive insights and answer key questions, including:
  - The effect of movie budgets on revenue.
  - Identifying the top 5 directors based on the number of films.
  - Evaluating the profitability of films directed by these top directors.
  - Specific analysis on films featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins.

## Methodology
### Data Wrangling
- Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and identify missing values.
- Clean the data by removing unnecessary columns and replacing zero values with mean values where applicable.
- Handle missing data appropriately and eliminate duplicates.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze the relationship between movie budgets and profits.
- Identify top directors and evaluate their films' profitability.
- Conduct specific analyses on Anthony Hopkins' films, including budget and revenue comparisons.

## Key Findings
- A positive correlation exists between budget and net profit, though exceptions exist.
- Woody Allen's films are not always profitable, while Clint Eastwood, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott have higher success rates.
- For Anthony Hopkins, the highest-budget film ("Thor: The Dark World") also ranks as the most profitable among his films.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into the film industry, particularly regarding the impact of budget on profitability and the performance of notable directors. The findings can inform future filmmaking and investment decisions in the entertainment sector.
